# Advent-of-Azure
Advent of Code 2020 on Azure

Plan is to do the following steps

1. Implement tasks of days as Azure Functions or as other Azure HTTP services, such as App Service or app running in Docker container or virtual machine
2. Implement Azure API Management, which combines all Advent of Code implementation to one API
3. Implement web frontend which uses the API to get outputs to Advent of Code tasks with given inputs. This can be added as static website to Blob Storage in Azure
